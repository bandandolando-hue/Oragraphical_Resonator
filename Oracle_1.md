🧩 A.) ARRAY — The Foundational Layer

The raw pattern. The unmediated state. The machine’s initial capture.

1. What the Array is

The Array is the six-channel binary (or ternary) pattern representing the moment being assessed.

It is:

Uninterpreted

Unshaped

Captured directly by the device

Before meaning, before metaphor

The symbolic equivalent of the I-Ching’s raw hexagram lines, but generated by a mechanical logic engine

In narrative terms:

> The Array is the world as the Engine sees it before the Engine thinks about it.

In aesthetic terms:

> Six shutters close. Six indicators freeze. The Array is recorded.

---

2. How the Array is structured

Six Channels

Each channel is a position in the Array, numbered I through VI.

Each Channel may have one of two basic states (binary engine):

Closed / Open

Engaged / Disengaged

Bright / Dim

Fixed / Unfixed

Or, if we go ternary (Victorian proto-logic):

0 / 1 / Ø (empty, active, unstable)

or

Stable / Unstable / Active

But for now, let’s stick to binary for clarity.

So an Array might look like:

1 0 1 1 0 0

Or symbolically:

● ○ ● ● ○ ○

---

3. How the Array is generated

This is flexible, but conceptually it comes from:

chance

input conditions

user interaction

atmospheric noise

fictive “aetheric variance”

or a mechanical pseudo-RNG

In Victorian terms:

> The Engine takes in ambient aether-charge and internal mechanical drift;
the shutters snap; the Array forms.

You can imagine:

a spinning drum

a flickering valve tube

a set of electromagnetic needles

a punchcard reader

six brass slats that flip from black to white

The Array is the moment’s signature, pre-interpretation.

---

4. What the Array represents symbolically

Just as hexagrams represent states of tension, stillness, expansion, contraction, etc.,
the Array represents the six-dimensional character of the moment.

Its meaning is not yet known — that comes later.

Right now it is:

raw

mechanical

procedural

objective

incomplete

This is the “world as detected”, not the “world as understood.”

---

5. Why the Array comes first

Because in your five-step structure, the Array is the:

Input

Foundation

Diagnostic snapshot

Pattern source

Everything else — Inculcation, Contours, Transmutation, and Actuation — derives from this initial capture.

Without the Array:

There is nothing to interpret,

nothing to shape,

nothing to transmute,

nothing to actuate.

It’s the primordial reading.

---

🔧 BOTTOM-UP SUMMARY OF STEP A: ARRAY

Definition: Raw six-channel pattern captured by the Engine.

Role: Input layer, pre-interpretation.

Meaning: None yet — pure data.

Form: 6 binary states.

Symbolic value: The moment before comprehension.

Mechanical metaphor: Brass shutters freeze into position.

Narrative metaphor: The world presents itself to the instrument.

🜛 B.) INCULCATION — The Impressed Meaning

This is the FIRST moment where interpretation enters.

If the Array is the raw measurement,
Inculcation is the act of engraving meaning onto that measurement.

This is the most Victorian word you could have chosen,
and it turns the oracle into something that feels:

scientific

ritualistic

psychological

alchemical

authoritative

a little dangerous

Let’s break it open.

---

🧩 1. What Inculcation is

Inculcation is the moment the Engine:

presses a conceptual frame onto the Array

impresses meaning into the raw pattern

stamps a principle into the reading

teaches the moment how it is to be understood

In esoteric-mechanical terms:

> The Engine takes the Array and engraves its interpretive glyphs upon it,
as though teaching the moment what lesson it carries.

This step is where the oracle begins to speak.

The tone changes here
from objective measurement to encoded significance.

---

🜙 2. The Mechanical Metaphor

Imagine:

Brass pistons compressing

A circular die stamping a thin copper plate

Engraving needles scratching an arcane diagram

A punchcard being imprinted with new perforations

Shutters aligning behind smoked glass

This is the Engine deciding how to read the Array.

You hear:

the hiss of pneumatic pressure,

the scrape of stylus on plate,

the ringing clack as gears lock into a new position.

This is the heartbeat of the oracle.

---

🜧 3. The Symbolic Function

In traditional I-Ching terms, Inculcation is the equivalent of:

The Judgement (what the hexagram means)

The first interpretive layer

The lesson, principle, or disposition

But your term elevates it.

The I-Ching offers a judgment.
Your Engine imposes a doctrine.

Meaning isn’t discovered —
it’s impressed.
As if the situation itself is being educated by the oracle.

This is a delightful inversion of the divinatory trope.

---

🜜 4. What Happens During Inculcation

The Engine examines the Array and assigns it:

a Principle

a Bias

an Interpretive Key

a Governing Idea

For example:

Array: 1 0 1 1 0 0
Inculcation Principle: “Constraint Precedes Strength”

The principle becomes the lens through which the upcoming steps are shaped.

You can think of it as the:

philosophy imprinted onto the raw pattern.

---

🜎 5. The Role of Inculcation in the Five-Step Structure

Your system is:

A.) Array →
B.) Inculcation →
C.) Contours →
D.) Transmutation →
E.) Actuation

The beauty here is:

Array is what is.

Inculcation is what the oracle says it means.

Contours will then visualize this meaning.
Transmutation will challenge or evolve it.
Actuation will finalize it.

Inculcation is the “doctrinal imprint” that guides everything downstream.

---

🜚 6. Why This Step is So Powerful

In metaphysical terms:
It inserts the interpretive seed.

In psychological terms:
It defines the mindset of the reading.

In narrative terms:
It is the incipient story the oracle is beginning to tell.

In mechanical terms:
It is the instruction code etched onto the Array.

Your system now mirrors:

a philosophical text,

an analytical engine,

and an alchemical treatise
all at once.

---

🜛 7. Examples of Inculcation Principles

These aren’t Actuations yet — these are the imposed meanings that shape the reading:

“Stability Demands Pressure.”

“Every Advance Casts a Shadow.”

“In Silence, Structures Reveal Themselves.”

“What Weakens Now Strengthens Later.”

“Discord Is the First Form of Harmony.”

“What Is Hidden Desires Emergence.”

Each one becomes the first truth the Engine teaches the moment.

Later, Contours will give these principles shape.
Transmutation will alter, expand, or erode them.
Actuation will finalize them.

But Inculcation is always the first word — the baseline meaning.

---

🜞 BOTTOM-UP SUMMARY OF STEP B: INCULCATION

Definition: The Engine’s interpretive imprint on the Array.

Metaphor: Brass die stamping meaning; the moment being taught.

Function: Assigns principle, bias, or doctrine.

Symbolic value: First layer of interpretation; the pattern’s lesson.

Role: Bridges raw data (Array) to meaningful shape (Contours).

Tone: Victorian, authoritative, scientific-occult.

Outcome: A philosophical gravity is imposed on the moment.

🜁 C.) CONTOURS — The Emergent Shape of Meaning

If Array is what is,
and Inculcation is what it means,
then Contours are:

> How that meaning occupies space.
How it bends the moment.
How it shapes possibility.

Contours are the topology of the reading —
the landscape, the geometry, the shape of forces at play.

Let’s unfold this layer with precision.

---

🜂 1. What Contours are

Contours are the pattern’s outline, the form its meaning takes once Inculcation has pressed a principle into it.

Imagine:

a faint diagram glowing behind glass

etched lines revealing the forces underneath

a topographic plate sliding into place

subtle geometries shifting beneath the surface

They’re not the principle itself —
they’re the shape that principle takes in this specific moment.

In other words:

> Contours = situational geometry.

---

🜃 2. The Mechanical Metaphor

This is the Engine’s most visually striking stage.

You might picture:

a round viewing lens with filigreed markings

thin luminous lines tracing over its surface like a planchette

a projected diagram of arcs and nodes

brass arms aligning at angles

a glass map with contour lines appearing like aether-drawn topography

This is where the Engine reveals rather than measures.

Contours are the visible ghost of the reading.

---

🜄 3. The Symbolic Function of Contours

In the I-Ching, the Image describes:

how the hexagram manifests in the world

the “stance” of the moment

advice on how to behave

In your oracle:

Contours sculpt the “behavioral field” of the moment.

They answer questions like:

Is the situation rising or falling?

Expanding outward or constricting inward?

Stable or oscillating?

Smooth or jagged?

Converging or dispersing?

Contours are the energetic posture of the reading.

---

🜅 4. The Relationship Between Inculcation and Contours

This is crucial:

Inculcation

imprints meaning
(a principle, a doctrine, a tilt)

Contours

give that meaning a shape
(the geometry of its expression)

Example:

Inculcation:
“Constraint Precedes Strength.”

Contours:

A narrowing funnel shape

Lines converging tightly at one point

A compressive geometry

Indicating pressure, narrowing, focus

The geometry visualizes the principle.

Contours are the middle child —
between meaning and movement (Transmutation).

---

🜆 5. Types of Contours (Conceptual Examples)

A) Rising Contour

Upward slope; ascent; tension increasing; elevation of stakes.

B) Descending Contour

Downward arc; decline; release; decompression.

C) Convergent Contour

Lines coming together; unity; coherence; focus.

D) Divergent Contour

Lines splitting apart; expansion; diffusion; losing cohesion.

E) Oscillating Contour

Wave-like; instability; uncertainty; volatility.

F) Angular / Broken Contour

Jagged; conflict; interference; disruption.

G) Circular / Encircling Contour

Containment; cycles; enclosure; repetition.

H) Spiral Contour

Evolution; deepening; transformation; cycling inward or outward.

These give the oracle tremendous expressive depth
without requiring mystical language.

---

🜇 6. How Contours Influence the Next Stage (Transmutation)

Contours determine:

which Channels are stressed

where tension builds or collapses

the loci of probable change

For example:

Convergent Contour → likely Channel III or IV Transmutation

Oscillating Contour → multiple Transmutations

Descending Contour → lower Channels transmute

Angular Contour → abrupt flips

Contours are the map Transmutation acts upon.

Where Inculcation tells the moment what lesson it carries,
Contours tell it how that lesson behaves.

---

🜈 7. Narrative Examples of Contours in Readings

Example 1 — Divergent Contour

> Thin lines spread outward across the glass plate.
The Contours indicate dispersal — focus is slipping to the edges.

Meaning: the situation is widening, attention is fragmenting.

---

Example 2 — Ascending Contour

> The diagram curves upward in a tight, luminous arc.
Forces incline toward elevation; pressure increases.

Meaning: you're rising into difficulty or opportunity.

---

Example 3 — Spiral Contour

> A slow inward coil begins to trace itself across the dial.
The moment is tightening around a central point.

Meaning: something is converging toward revelation or collapse.

---

🜉 BOTTOM-UP SUMMARY OF STEP C: CONTOURS

Definition: The emergent diagram or geometry of the meaning.

Symbolic role: The shape of forces at play; the situational terrain.

Mechanical metaphor: Brass or glass displays etched with topographic lines.

Function: Translates principle into actionable geometry.

Relationship: Sits between meaning (Inculcation) and change (Transmutation).

Outcome: A map of potential shifts and tensions.

🜏 D.) TRANSMUTATION — The Shifting of Channels

The instability. The reaction. The mutiny of the pattern.

This is where the oracle moves.
It is no longer interpreting — it is acting upon the Array.

Let’s dissect this with precision and atmospheric rigor.

---

🜐 1. What Transmutation is

Transmutation is the stage where the Engine detects instability in the Contours
and must reprocess certain Channels.

A Transmutation Channel is:

stressed

resonant

overburdened

discordant

active

volatile

so the Engine flips, mutates, or advances it.

In older alchemical language:

> The base matter reveals where it desires refinement.

In your system:

> Geometry strains → Channels shift.

This is the oracle’s first dynamic moment.

---

🜑 2. The Mechanical Metaphor

Transmutation is loud.
It is physical.
It is unmistakable.

You might hear:

a sharp metallic snap as a Channel flips

a pressure valve hiss

gears clacking in irregular rhythm

a flickering of indicator lights

a pulse through an inductive coil

Upon the diagram:

certain Contour lines shatter, warp, or intensify

nodes glow brighter

pressure gradients form within the pattern

Think:

> A machine catching its breath,
then reconfiguring its internal logic on the fly.

As if the reading fights back.

---

🜒 3. The Symbolic Function

In the I-Ching, changing lines:

highlight tension

indicate evolution

shift the reading from one hexagram to the next

In your system, Transmutation:

responds directly to the Contours

emphasizes where meaning is unstable

reassigns the moment’s internal architecture

alters the potential outcome landscape

determines the next state of the Array

If Inculcation says,

> “This is the lesson,”
Contours say,
“This is the shape of the situation,”
then Transmutation says,
“This is where things cannot stay as they are.”

It is the necessary transformation.

---

🜓 4. Types of Transmutation Events

Based on the Contour type, Transmutation behaves differently:

A. Convergent Contours → Central Transmutation

Channels III or IV flip.

B. Divergent Contours → Peripheral Transmutation

Channels I or VI flip.

C. Oscillating Contours → Multiple Transmutations

Two or more Channels shift.

D. Angular Contours → Abrupt Transmutation

A Channel flips dramatically — full inversion.

E. Descending Contours → Lower Transmutation

Channels V or VI shift.

F. Ascending Contours → Upper Transmutation

Channels I or II shift.

G. Spiral Contours → Cascading Transmutation

One flip triggers another — domino effect.

H. Circular Contours → Rotational Transmutation

Channels cycle through values rather than flip.

This variety gives your oracle complexity with zero mysticism required —
just mechanics responding to geometry.

---

🜔 5. Transmutation’s Relationship to the Other Layers

Array → Raw data.

Inculcation → First meaning.

Contours → Structure of meaning.

Transmutation → Meaning in motion.

Without Transmutation, the oracle would be static.
It would speak but never transform.

Transmutation is the alchemical heartbeat —
the moment of heat, pressure, reaction.

This is the stage where the Engine pulls the moment forward,
and where the reading begins to reveal its ultimate state.

---

🜕 6. Example Descriptions in Readings

Example 1 — Single Transmutation

> A flash behind the Channel III plate.
The brass shutters reset in a sudden motion.
Transmutation enacted: Channel III advances.

Example 2 — Dual Transmutation

> Two points on the glass flare in tandem.
The Contours strain and rupture.
Channels II and V transmute in sympathetic motion.

Example 3 — Cascading Transmutation

> A spiral pulse races across the dial.
One Channel flips, pulling another into alignment.
Stabilization fails — a tertiary Transmutation occurs.

Example 4 — Rotational Transmutation

> The lower plates turn like a safe’s tumblers.
Each Channel shifts one position forward.
A cycling of the moment begins.

---

🜖 7. The Purpose of Transmutation

Transmutation exists so that:

Actuation is not merely a readout
but a resolved outcome.

The oracle is not static
but interactive with the moment.

Meaning becomes process
not merely interpretation.

This is the most important philosophical point:

> The reading itself transforms the situation.
The oracle is not passive — it intervenes.

Victorian occultists would have DIed for this.

---

🜗 BOTTOM-UP SUMMARY OF STEP D: TRANSMUTATION

Definition: The Engine’s adjustment of unstable Channels.

Symbolic role: The transformation pressure in the moment.

Mechanical metaphor: Flips, clicks, pulses, cascades.

Function: Redirects the reading toward its final outcome.

Relationship: Acts on Contours to reshape the Array.

Outcome: A modified pattern ready for Actuation.

🜙 E.) ACTUATION — The Final Omen

The resolved state. The verdict. The output of the Engine’s intervention.

This is the step the Victorians would have written about in trembling notebooks.
This is what the alchemical-mechanical apparatus is for.
This is where the reading ends — and reality begins to shift.

Let’s unfurl it fully.

---

🜚 1. What Actuation is

Actuation is:

the final pattern after Transmutation

the outcome produced by the Engine

the gesture the oracle makes toward the world

the message, omen, directive, or verdict

But more essentially:

> Actuation is the moment the Engine commits.

Every prior phase is exploratory, interpretive, diagnostic.
Actuation is declarative.

This is where the oracle speaks with authority.

---

🜛 2. The Mechanical Metaphor

Actuation has weight.

You might hear:

the final kachunk of a locking gear

a rising whine followed by sudden quiet

the ratcheting of plates settling into permanent position

a stylus engraving its last line into the copper disk

a hot valve releasing a puff of steam

The viewing dial clears.
The final diagram freezes.
The machine rests.

The Actuation is complete.

---

🜜 3. The Symbolic Function of Actuation

In the I-Ching, the Actuation corresponds to:

the secondary hexagram that emerges after changing lines

the ultimate insight

the core message of the consultation

But in your system, Actuation is more deliberate.

The Engine has:

read the Array

imposed meaning (Inculcation)

shaped that meaning into geometry (Contours)

transformed unstable elements (Transmutation)

And Actuation is the resultant reality.
It reflects both the moment and the Engine’s intervention.

It is the reading’s final stance.

---

🜝 4. What an Actuation Contains

Every Actuation includes:

A.) Name / Designation

e.g.

“The Tempered Span”

“The Divergent Coil”

“The Emergent Faultline”

“The Harmonized Bearing”

“The Encircled Interval”

B.) Pattern Signature

The final six-channel configuration.

C.) Principle Affirmation

A distilled version of the Inculcation’s lesson.

D.) Contour Interpretation

How the geometry resolves into trend or posture.

E.) Transmutation Insight

What changed — and what that change signifies.

F.) Directive

A short, potent advisory.

Example:

> Actuation 19: The Slanted Meridian
Final pattern indicates rising asymmetry.
What was stable is under subtle drift.
Recommendation: Proceed with care; recalibrate expectations.

---

🜞 5. Types of Actuations (structurally)

Here are a few broad categories you might build:

1. Stabilizing Actuations

Calm, resolution, fortification, endurance.

2. Divergent Actuations

Expansion, scattering, diffusion, disorganization.

3. Convergent Actuations

Focus, unification, crystallization, advancement.

4. Oscillatory Actuations

Instability, unpredictability, cycling tension.

5. Catalytic Actuations

Sudden change, breakthrough, disruption.

6. Containment Actuations

Boundaries, reflection, pause, pressure.

7. Spiral Actuations

Deepening, recursion, transformation, metamorphosis.

8. Liminal Actuations

Threshold moments, in-between states, ambiguity.

These map naturally onto your Contours and Transmutation types.

---

🜟 6. Examples of Fully Written Actuations

Actuation 08 — The Tempered Span

> A long pressure has refined the moment.
Stability forming under strain.
Advice: Hold steady; endurance completes the arc.

—

Actuation 31 — The Divergent Coil

> Forces move outward, splitting commitment.
Energy dissipates unless reclaimed.
Advice: Re-consolidate resources; draw inward.

—

Actuation 44 — The Aetheric Breach

> A foreign influence crosses the threshold.
Transmutation cascaded through Channels II and V.
Advice: Observe with caution; react only after clarity forms.

—

Actuation 12 — The Harmonized Bearing

> Contours converge in rare symmetry.
Whatever begins now will proceed smoothly.
Advice: Advance; momentum is aligned.

---

🜠 7. The Philosophical Purpose of Actuation

Actuation converts:

instability → trajectory

geometry → guidance

principle → action

probability → orientation

Your oracle is not predictive.
It is directive.

It positions you in relation to the forces revealed.

In Victorian pseudo-science terms:

> “The Engine does not foretell the future;
it calibrates your bearing toward it.”

This brings your system full circle with mechanical coherence and symbolic potency.

---

🜡 BOTTOM-UP SUMMARY OF STEP E: ACTUATION

Definition: The Engine’s final, resolved omen.

Symbolic role: Outcome, directive, declared stance.

Mechanical metaphor: Locking gears, engraved plates, final resting of the apparatus.

Function: Bridges interpretation to action.

Relationship: Emerges from all prior layers.

Outcome: A precise, potent insight.

---

3. CONTOURS — Geometry of that meaning

4. TRANSMUTATION — Necessary transformation

5. ACTUATION — Final resolved outcome

🜙 A.) THE FIRST SET OF ACTUATIONS

You need a foundational set — not all 64, not even 32.
We start with 12 Actuations, mirroring the elegance of early mechanical dials.

Each Actuation includes:

Name

---

🜁 E.) THE SYMBOL SYSTEM (Mechanical Glyphics)

Your oracle needs a visual lexicon — symbols users can learn at a glance.

Below are the glyphic families for the system.

No images — just conceptual designs ready for later rendering.

---

1. ARRAY SYMBOLS (Channel States)

Binary states can be represented mechanically as:

Filled Circle (●)

Engaged, bright, active channel.

Hollow Circle (○)

Disengaged, dim, passive channel.

Other possible glyphs:

Vertical plate ( | )

Horizontal shutter ( — )

Valve indicator dot

Electromagnetic needle orientation

But ● and ○ remain the cleanest symbolic shorthand.

---

2. INCULCATION SYMBOLS (Principle Marks)

These are engraved indicators used by the Engine to mark the interpretive principle.

Examples:

Triangle (Δ) — ascent, striving, growth

Square (□) — containment, structure

Chevron (›) — movement, pressure

Crossbar (+) — balance, junction

Spiral Line (Ϙ) — transformation

Each Inculcation mark is small, stamped beside the Array
like a printer’s notation.

---

3. CONTOUR GLYPHS (Diagrammatic Forms)

Contours should resemble Victorian technical diagrams.

Arc (∩ or ∪)

Rising or falling movement.

Fork (⧓ or Y-shape)

Convergence or divergence.

Waveform (≈ or ~)

Oscillation.

Circle (◯)

Enclosure or boundary.

Spiral (↺ or ↻)

Transformation or recurrence.

Broken Line (⌇ or ⦂)

Rupture, fracture.

These glyphs are drawn faintly over the Array
as a kind of mechanical “overlay.”

---

4. TRANSMUTATION SIGILS

Used to mark which Channels shift.

Spark Mark (⚡)

Sudden flip.

Chevron Shift (» or «)

Directional advancement.

Double Slash (//)

Cascading shift.

Rotary Mark (⟳)

Rotational Transmutation.

Three Dots (…)

Unstable set; may indicate further shift.

They appear briefly before Actuation freezes.

---

5. ACTUATION SEALS

Each Actuation gets a unique emblem —
simple, recognizable, mechanical.

Examples:

Span: ═

Coil: Ϟ

Meridian: |·|

Faultline: /⟂

Ingress: ◎→

Aperture: ↗◯

These can be standardized later, but the symbolic vocabulary is now established.

To keep it coherent (and not just 64 random cool names), we’ll do:

8 Contour families × 8 Actuations each = 64

Families:

1. Ascendant (rising, intensifying)

2. Descendant (releasing, declining)

3. Convergent (focusing, unifying)

4. Divergent (spreading, opening)

5. Oscillatory (fluctuating, unstable)

6. Angular / Faultline (breaks, shocks, discontinuities)

7. Circular / Enclosed (cycles, bounds, containment)

8. Spiral (transformative, liminal, recursive)

I’ve slotted your existing 12 into this grid and filled out the rest to keep the vibe consistent.

Each Actuation has:

Number – Name

Contour Family

Insight (what it says about the situation)

Directive (what to do with it)

You can rename/tune later, but this gives us a solid canonical draft.

---

1–8: ASCENDANT FORMS (Rising Pressure, Opportunity, Elevation)

01 — Ascendant Vector
Family: Ascendant
Insight: Momentum climbs in a clear direction; forces align toward elevation.
Directive: Advance deliberately; ride the climb rather than sprinting it.

02 — Tempered Climb
Family: Ascendant
Insight: Progress upward is slow but steady; resistance refines strength.
Directive: Accept the drag; persistence is the true gain.

03 — Lantern Apex
Family: Ascendant
Insight: A high vantage point is within reach; visibility is improving.
Directive: Seek perspective; make decisions from the highest view you can access.

04 — Overloaded Rise
Family: Ascendant
Insight: Ascent is burdened; too much is being carried upward.
Directive: Lighten the load before proceeding, or the climb will fail.

05 — Cresting Arc
Family: Ascendant
Insight: The situation approaches its peak; gains are near maximum.
Directive: Make your key move now, before the curve starts to fall.

06 — Thinning Atmosphere
Family: Ascendant
Insight: Higher elevation yields isolation; support structures thin out.
Directive: Do not overextend; secure your base as you rise.

07 — Rung of Ascent
Family: Ascendant
Insight: This is a step, not the summit; progress is incremental by design.
Directive: Treat this as staging, not arrival; plan the next rung.

🜁 1. Core Nomenclature (Immutable)
The Casting Steps

These five steps correspond to the updated, futuristic-victorian, Excitant-inspired oracle sequence:

Array
→ The six-value binary pattern generated by RNG or seeded roll.

Inculcation
→ The interpretive key or guiding principle modulating the Array.

Contours
→ The shaping/trajectory influence applied to the Array during transformation.

Transmutation
→ The actual mechanical change(s) applied to the Array (flips, shifts, dual shifts, inversions).

Actuation
→ The manifested result: 1 of 64 Excitant-era outcome forms.

🜂 2. The 64 Actuations

We do NOT call them “hexagrams,” “results,” “forms,” or “readings.”

The correct term is:

Actuations

Each Actuation is:

Numbered 1–64

Assigned to one of the eight Families

Has:

Name

Family

Insight

Directive

Glyph

NO other terminology should be used.

🜃 3. The Eight Families (immutable):

Ascendant

Descendant

Convergent

Divergent

Oscillatory

Angular

Circular

Spiral

These are families, not “forms” or “archetypes” or “domains”.

Correct phrasing:

“Family: Convergent”

NOT: “Convergent Form” (this is deprecated)

🜄 4. Glyph System (canonical)
Glyph composition:

Each Actuation glyph =

Root Shape (family identifier)

Mark (individual identifier)

Every SVG is named using:

NN-slug-of-name.svg


Example:

24-central-bearing.svg


Inside /public/glyphs/actuations/.

🜅 5. Canonical UI language
The correct UI labels:

“Array (initial)”

“Inculcation:”

“Contour:”

“Transmutation:”

“Array (final)”

“Actuation NN — Name”

“Family: Convergent”

Insight: “...”

Directive: “...”

Deprecate:

“Convergent Form”

“Outcome”

“Hexagram”

“Reading Type”

🜆 6. Engine Expectations

The system must support:

RNG or seeded casting

deterministic replay via same seed

exposure of:

Array initial

Inculcation applied

Contour applied

Transmutation log

Final Array

Actuation number → glyph → insight/directive

Missing modules in this particular repo should eventually be:

engine/seededCast.ts

engine/describe.ts

engine/castStore.ts

types.ts

But these are NOT part of the canon — only convenience modules.

🜇 7. Visual Identity Baseline

Use this:

“Victorian-mechanical-nouveau oracle interface rendered as brass, glass, and etheric machinery; a concentric-ring casting device revealing a luminous glyph at the heart of an arcane orb.”

This is the internal aesthetic reference for the Orb + Brass Reader.

🜈 8. What should never change

The five casting steps

The eight Families

The term Actuation

The fact that every Actuation has:
→ number, name, family, insight, directive, glyph

actuationsWithGlyphs.ts is the truth-table for frontend

backend/data/actuations.ts is canonical data for backend

Glyph naming convention

Actuation names & family assignments

All insight + directive text

Nomenclature for array transformation pipeline

🐦 Paste This Into the Next Thread and Say:

“Load the Oragraphical Resonator Canon Baseline.”

When you do that, the assistant will enter the Resonator dialect cleanly, without mixing in old structures or alternate naming conventions.

This also ensures that:

“Convergent Form” will never appear again

All future UI/UX and engine work aligns with the Excitant terms

No subsystem backslides into I-Ching or code-era vocabulary

If you'd like, I can now:

✔ Refactor App.tsx to show correct canon wording
✔ Ensure the Orb UI uses the Family name properly
✔ Audit your restored files to correct lingering drift
✔ Rebuild missing engine modules in this nomenclature
✔ Or generate a permanent /src/canon.ts file to bootstrap future dev

Just tell me the next step.
